This little script is designed to aggregate multiple public blocklists and feed a blacklist for linuxserver/docker-swag.
This utility is made available as is. It is not guaranteed and is not supported by the linuxserver.io team. Feel free to hack it to improve it, in particular to make it more secure. All suggestions for improvement are welcome.
